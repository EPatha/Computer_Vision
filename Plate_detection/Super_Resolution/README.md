# Test Super Resolution
# ESRGAN Master

This repository contains code for Super Resolution (ESRGAN) and other image processing tasks, including Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR).

## Files in this Repository

### 1. `ESRGAN-master.zip`
- This file contains the core ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks) model for image upscaling. It should be extracted and used as the primary model for enhancing image resolutions.

### 2. `super_resolusi.py`
- This Python script implements the ESRGAN model for super-resolution. It takes low-resolution images as input and uses the ESRGAN model to enhance their resolution.

### 3. `test-ANPR.ipynb`
- This Jupyter Notebook contains a test implementation for Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR). It demonstrates how to apply ANPR techniques on images and process license plate data.

### 4. `test.py`
- A Python script that contains a basic example of using ESRGAN and other functionalities. It is designed to be run after setting up the required libraries and dependencies.
